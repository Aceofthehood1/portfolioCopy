              <p class="gallery-item-description">On this page, the admin can add new dishes that will be shown on the main site and it will also be seen on the list of menu items page also. The reason the title of this page is "Edit Dish" is because the edit dish and add dish functionality both make use of this page but what they do is different. The add dish function adds the dish when the dish is not in the database, if the dish is already in the database, then it will be edited. This was done to reduce repetition for the code and to prevent the users from having the same dish and showing that on the site. This was done for the other edit pages too. </p>
